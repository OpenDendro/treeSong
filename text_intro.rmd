## Introduction
Introducing **treeSong**, an interactive Shiny application designed to bring tree-ring data to life through sonification. Whether you're working with a preloaded dataset or uploading your own, treeSong allows you to turn a time series into an auditory experience. By converting a filtered spectral density function into a waveform within the audible range for humans, you can hear the data in the frequency domain.

With **treeSong**, you have control over the complexity of the waveform. Adjust the number of tones to include, and discover different levels of intricacy in your audio representation. You can also specify the pitch range, spanning from a low A on a piano to the highest A (A0 to A7), offering a wide spectrum of tonal possibilities. Additionally, customize the duration of the waveform to determine how long the audio will play.

For further work and easy sharing, treeSong allows you to download the generated audio as a high-quality WAV file. This compatibility ensures seamless integration with various audio players and editors. Additionally, you can generate a visualization similar to an oscilloscope. This can be saved as a video file.

Immerse yourself in the captivating noise hidden within tree-ring data with **treeSong**, and uncover the mesmerizing auditory patterns that exist in the natural world.
