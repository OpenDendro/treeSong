Upload (drag or browse) a CSV file readable by [read_csv](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html). The columns should contain series and have headers. An example of detrended ring widths from the [co021](https://rdrr.io/cran/dplR/man/co021.html) data set is [here](https://github.com/OpenDendro/treeSong/blob/main/co021RWI.csv). Or you can use the demo data which has two series, one from an energy-limited system and one from a water-limited system.
