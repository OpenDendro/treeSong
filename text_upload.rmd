Upload (drag or browse) a CSV file readable by [read_csv](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html). The first column must have a time index (e.g., Years) and subsequent columns need the series. An example is [here](https://github.com/OpenDendro/treeSong/blob/main/co021RWI.csv). Or you can use the demo data which has two series, one from an energy-limited system and one from a water-limited system.
